# Product SKU available in cart

Added: 2016-01-28

Affects: `cart.html`

Control Panel: `Products > Edit a Product > Details > Summary > Product code/SKU`, `Products > Edit a Product > Options`

> You can now access the SKU for items in the cart through the Cart object's `cart.items.sku` property. (BIG-25731)

It might make sense for some themes to show the product SKU in the cart. Should be discussed with the designer.
