# Add city to shipping estimator

Added: 2016-02-10

Affects: `cart.html`

> The Cart object now has a `cart.selected_city` property, for the city/town that a customer selects for shipping estimates. In Stencil's default Cornerstone theme, the shipping-estimator step now prompts the shopper for the shipping city. (BIG-25579)
