# Non-sale price

Added: 2016-02-10

Affects: `price.html`

> The global Catalog Price object now contains `non_sale_price_with_tax` and `non_sale_price_without_tax` properties. During sale events, these can be used to display a store's standard prices, alongside the sale and list prices. (MERC-63)

TODO: Decide if we should use the non-sale price instead of the RRSP.
